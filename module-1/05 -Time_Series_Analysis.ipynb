    "# TIME SERIES ANALYSIS \n",
    "## 1. Introduction to Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is a time series?\n",
    "- Examples of time series data (e.g., stock prices, weather data, sales data).\n",
    "- Difference between time series data vs. cross-sectional data.\n",
    "- Importance of time series analysis in business, economics, and science.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're tracking your daily steps on a fitness app. Over time, you notice patterns—maybe you walk more on weekends or hit fewer steps on rainy days. This kind of data, recorded at consistent time intervals, is called time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Time Series?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series is simply a sequence of data points collected over time. Each observation is linked to a specific timestamp — whether it's seconds, minutes, days, months, or years. Unlike a random collection of numbers, time series data has an order, and that order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of Time Series Data** \n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data is everywhere! Here are some common examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stock Prices – How Apple’s stock fluctuates daily.\n",
    "* Weather Patterns – Daily temperature changes over a year.\n",
    "* Sales Data – Monthly revenue of an e-commerce store.\n",
    "* Heart Rate Monitoring – Data from a smartwatch tracking your pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series vs. Cross-Sectional Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Time Series Data tracks* the same variable over different time periods. (E.g., daily stock prices of Tesla for one year.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cross-Sectional Data* captures multiple variables at a single point in time. (E.g., income levels of 1,000 people in 2024.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is Time Series Analysis Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding time series data helps us:\n",
    "\n",
    "📈 Predict the future (e.g., will Bitcoin rise next month?).\n",
    "📊 Identify trends (e.g., is global warming getting worse?).\n",
    "⚡ Make smarter business decisions (e.g., when should a store restock its inventory?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're forecasting sales, detecting fraud, or analyzing climate change, time series analysis is a powerful tool. Ready to dive deeper? Let’s explore! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components of Time Series** \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/time-series-components.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above graph represents an example of a time series data. To understand the underlying structure in time series, it is broken down into three components; trend, seasonality and noise. These components characterize the pattern and behavior of data over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Trend*; This will show the general direction of data whether it is upward(increasing) or downward(decreasing). They indicate long-term movement depicting overall growth or decline. The above chart shows that there was an overall growth(upward trend) over the year\n",
    "2. *Seasonality*; It is the predictable pattern that appear regularly. In the chart above there is a quarterly rise and drop of values.\n",
    "3. *Cycles*; represents the fluctuations that don't have a fixed period.\n",
    "4. *Noise/Irregularity*; its is the residual variability of data that has no explanations by the factors affecting the trend. The variability is always small compared to the trend and cycle. "
